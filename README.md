# Hi, I'm Alex üëã

I'm an **Industrial Engineering student** and passionate electronics enthusiast with a deep interest in **control systems** and **PCB design**. I enjoy working on projects that merge the world of hardware and software, focusing on creating precise and efficient systems for motor control, automation, and beyond. 

## üîß Current Projects

### üî© **PowerServo AE: A Smart Servo Motor with Absolute Encoding**
**PowerServo AE** is my flagship project open hardware and open software **Brushed DC motor controller** designed for high-precision motor control. This controller supports **6-24V** at **3.6A continuous** and **5.5A peak**, delivering **9-bit speed control** and **13-bit angle precision**. With this closed-loop system, I aim to achieve accurate motor control (down to 0.05 degrees), making it perfect for high-precision tasks such as **micro-engraving** or **tool head positioning**.
In the future, I plan to develop multiple variations of the PowerServo AE for high-power, low-power, high-voltage, and low-voltage applications.

### üîß **Dumb, Precision Solder Paste Spreader**
Another project I'm tinkering with is implementing my PowerServo project into a precision XY Toolhead, which for my own practical purposes will be solder paste seringe w/ dispenser.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Past Projects
- **Airbrake Control Board** for a sounding rocket
- **Groundstation** for rocket communication and control
- **Tracking Turret Antenna** with advanced control systems
- **Custom Sensor Boards**

## üéØ Project Interests
I'm always looking for new challenges that involve:
- **Control Systems Design**
- **PCB Layout & Design**
- **Motor Control & Automation**

## üõ† Tech Stack & Tools
- **Microcontrollers:** STM32 series (e.g., STM32G0B1CBT6), RP2040, ESP32
- **Programming:** C, Python
- **Tools:** MathCAD (for modeling physical systems), STM32 CubeIDE, KiCAD, EagleEDA, Fusion360

## üöÄ Future Goals
- Expand the **PowerServo AE** project and release a series of variations for different power/voltage levels.
- Develop more open-source projects that can be integrated into larger projects.
- Continue refining my skills in **PCB design** and control algorithms to push the boundaries of what's possible in **embedded systems**.

Feel free to check out my repositories and follow along on my journey! I'm always happy to collaborate or chat about all things electronics and control systems.
