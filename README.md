# Hi, I'm Alex 👋

I'm an **Industrial Engineering student** and passionate electronics enthusiast with a deep interest in **control systems** and **PCB design**. I enjoy working on projects that merge the world of hardware and software, focusing on creating precise and efficient systems for motor control, automation, and beyond. 

## 🔧 Current Projects

### 🔩 **DCServo AE: A Smart Servo Motor with Absolute Encoding**
**DCServo AE** is my flagship project open hardware and open software **Brushed DC motor controller** designed for high-precision motor control. This controller supports **6-36V** at **4.1A continuous** and **5.5A peak**, delivering **10-bit speed control** and **13-bit angle precision**. With this closed-loop system, I aim to achieve accurate motor control (down to 0.05 degrees), making it perfect for high-precision tasks.

### 🔧 **Dumb, Precision Solder Paste Spreader**
Another project I'm tinkering with is implementing my DCServo project into a precision XY Toolhead, which for my own practical purposes will be solder paste seringe w/ dispenser.

## ⚙️ Past Projects
- **Airbrake Control Board** for a sounding rocket
- **Groundstation** for rocket communication and control
- **Tracking Turret Antenna** with advanced control systems
- **Custom Sensor Boards**

## 🎯 Project Interests
I'm always looking for new challenges that involve:
- **Control Systems Design**
- **PCB Layout & Design**
- **Motor Control & Automation**

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
- **Microcontrollers:** STM32 (typically G0 and H5), RP2040, ESP32, Teensy, Arduino
- **Programming:** Embedded C (STM32), Arduino C, Python
- **Tools:** MathCAD, STM32 CubeIDE, KiCAD, EagleEDA, Fusion360

## 🚀 Future Goals
- Develop more open-source projects that can be integrated into larger projects.
